# Copilot / AI agent instructions — course_registration

This is a small Django (4.2) project. The goal of these notes is to give an AI coding agent the minimal, actionable knowledge to be productive quickly.

- Project type: Django web app (single project `course_registration`) with one installed app: `courses`.
- Framework: Django 4.2.x (settings generated by `django-admin startproject`).

Quick architecture summary
- Project root `course_registration/` contains the Django project settings and top-level views (`course_registration/views.py`).
- App `courses/` is registered in `INSTALLED_APPS` but currently contains no models. Expect business logic and DB models to go there (`courses/models.py`, `courses/admin.py`).
- HTML templates live in the top-level `templates/` directory (e.g. `templates/login.html`, `admin_dashbord.html`, `materials.html`). Project views render those templates directly.
- Static files placed under `static/` (served via `STATICFILES_DIRS` in `course_registration/settings.py`).
- URLs are configured in `course_registration/urls.py` and mostly point to functions in `course_registration/views.py` (not the `courses` app).

Developer workflows (commands you will run)
- Create/activate venv (this repo contains a `.venv/` in workspace; if not present):
  - `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: there is no requirements file tracked; install Django and DB driver for local dev as needed (e.g. `pip install django psycopg2-binary`).
- Database: settings use PostgreSQL (see `course_registration/settings.py` DATABASES block). Locally ensure Postgres is running, create the DB `course_registration` or change to sqlite for quick testing.
- Migrations and runserver:
  - `python manage.py makemigrations` (if creating models)
  - `python manage.py migrate`
  - `python manage.py createsuperuser` (optional admin)
  - `python manage.py runserver`
- Tests: use Django test runner: `python manage.py test`.

Project-specific conventions / patterns
- Page-first approach: many simple pages are implemented as lightweight project-level views that directly `render(request, '<template>.html')` (see `course_registration/views.py`). To add a new page, add a view in `course_registration/views.py`, create the template in `templates/`, and add a path in `course_registration/urls.py`.
- App-responsibility: `courses` is the designated place for domain models and admin registration. Add models to `courses/models.py` and register them in `courses/admin.py`.
- Templates are not namespaced by app; they live in the single `templates/` folder. Use unique filenames to avoid collisions.

Integration points / external dependencies
- PostgreSQL — configured in `course_registration/settings.py`. Connection info (NAME/USER/PASSWORD/HOST/PORT) are stored in settings currently.
- Django admin is available at `/admin/` (standard admin site). Register models in `courses/admin.py` to expose them.

Editing examples (concrete snippets to follow in PRs)
- Add a new page:
  - Edit `course_registration/views.py`:
    - `def new_page(request): return render(request, 'new_page.html')`
  - Add `templates/new_page.html`
  - Add path in `course_registration/urls.py`: `path('new-page/', views.new_page, name='new_page')`
- Add a model and admin registration:
  - `courses/models.py`: add a model class inheriting from `models.Model`
  - `courses/admin.py`: `from .models import MyModel` then `admin.site.register(MyModel)`
  - Run `makemigrations` / `migrate`

Notes and caveats discovered from the codebase
- Sensitive data in repo: `SECRET_KEY` and DB credentials live in `course_registration/settings.py`. Treat them as secrets when creating commits or PRs — prefer environment variables for replacements.
- The `courses` app is mostly scaffolded. Expect most functional work (models, forms, API endpoints) to be added there; but keep in mind many UI routes are currently implemented at the project-level.

Files to inspect first when making changes
- `course_registration/settings.py` — DB, static, templates, INSTALLED_APPS
- `course_registration/urls.py` and `course_registration/views.py` — current page routes and handlers
- `templates/` — existing templates and naming conventions
- `courses/models.py`, `courses/admin.py` — where domain model work belongs

If anything above is unclear or you want me to expand with examples (e.g., adding a sample model + migration or switching to sqlite for dev), tell me which area to elaborate on and I will update this file.
